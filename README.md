###  ðŸ“š Installation & Setup

1. Git clone this repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/wkdalsgh192/atm-controller.git
   ```

   

2. Install or upgrade python to 3.8.3

   If you have not installed Python or the current version is lower than the requirement, download a new release [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **The version should be above 3.8.3 **

   

3. Run a script

   If you want to see whether the controller works fine, run this controller directly:

   ```
   python controller.py
   ```

   If you want to know how I've tested the code, run the test code:

   ```
   python test.py
   ```
